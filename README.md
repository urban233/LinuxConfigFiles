# LinuxConfigFiles
This is a repo where I collect all my config files for various linux applications.

## Content
- bashrc
- bash_profile
- config.fish
- starship.toml
- config (from Terminator)

## Installation
First clone this repo. 
```
git clone https://github.com/urban233/LinuxConfigFiles.git
```
This is useful to do, because when the repo gets updated, you will get the changes in the repo directory.
You can update the repo with following command:
```
git pull
```
**Important**: you have to run the command in the directory of the GitHub repository!<br/>
To use these config files, add them in the appropriate directory. These can be found in the subfolders for each application (shell).

## Contributing
If you wish to share your modified config files with this repo, start a pull request. This should prevent messing up my config files.
